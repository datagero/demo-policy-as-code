# sensitive_fields_mapping.yml
# A central mapping between DBT column names and anonymisation tagging policy logic.
# Used to drive inference and validation for column_security_role tagging across data products.

  description: >
    Free-text summary of what this field represents in business terms.
  col_type: >
    Canonical data type used to group columns under shared masking/anonymisation logic.
    Examples: uk_post_cd, email, birth_date. This helps cluster fields that share anonymisation semantics.
  sec_type: >
    Security intent of the policy.
    Use 'M' for full masking (default), or 'P' for partial anonymisation based on role visibility.
  mask_policy: >
    Final masking policy name to apply. If not provided, it will be inferred from col_type, sec_type, and role_name.
  last_updated: >
    ISO-style timestamp indicating the last manual update of this entry.
